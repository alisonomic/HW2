            <span> My name is Alison Archer and I am currently exploring the wonderful world of coding. My interest in the field was sparked almost suddenly one year ago while I was on a self discovery journey.</span>
            <br>
            <span></span> It's manifestation is not that surprising as I have always had an affinity for anything tech related and have always worked in and around IOT.</span>
            <br>
            <span> My interests include reading anything from the mystery section, listening to most music genres while making playlists on Spotify, keeping up with politics both locally and nationally, and anticipating the next big thing from mobile devices. Sorry Samsung, love your slogan but I live in the Apple ecosystem. Funnily enough as a self-proclaimed introvert I actually do not partake in social media and am pretty impossible to find on Google.</span>
